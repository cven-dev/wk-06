# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Week 6 course material for CVEN 5999: Special Topics - Data Analytics for Development, focusing on comprehensive data analysis using the What a Waste global dataset.

## Week 6 Content

- **Complex Data Analysis**: Multi-section analysis workflow
- **What a Waste Dataset**: Global waste management data analysis
- **Advanced Techniques**: Combining multiple data analysis skills

## File Structure

- `hw-06a-section-01.qmd`: First section of comprehensive analysis
- `hw-06b-section-02.qmd`: Second section (with solutions)
- `hw-06c-section-03.qmd`: Third section (with solutions)
- `hw-06d-section-04.qmd`: Fourth section (with solutions)
- `learning-06.qmd`: Learning reflection
- `data/what_a_waste/`: Comprehensive What a Waste city-level datasets
- `img/`: Analysis outputs and visualizations

## Key Datasets

- **What a Waste**: Global city-level waste management data
- **Composition Data**: Waste stream composition by city
- **Treatment Data**: Waste treatment methods and coverage
- **Generation Data**: Waste generation rates by city
- **Income Data**: Country income classifications
- **Population Data**: City population figures
- **Distance Data**: Geographic analysis variables

## Data Structure

- Multiple CSV files for different aspects of waste management
- Pre-processed RDS files for efficient loading
- Comprehensive city-level analysis across multiple dimensions
- Country-income classifications for comparative analysis

## Analysis Approach

- Multi-section homework structure (sections 01-04)
- Integration of all previous week's techniques
- Complex data joining and analysis
- Advanced visualization and summary statistics
- Treatment analysis by income levels

## Key Learning Objectives

- Apply comprehensive data analysis workflow
- Work with large, complex real-world datasets
- Integrate multiple data sources
- Create publication-quality analysis and visualizations
- Understand global waste management patterns
